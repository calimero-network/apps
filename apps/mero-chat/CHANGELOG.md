## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Search is `search_messages(query, cursor, limit)`: newest first, a bounded
  amount of work per call, slim hits with a snippet, and a cursor for the next
  page. Text is matched as it is shown and folded for case and accents.
  `search_all_messages` is removed; the app falls back to it for contexts still
  on an older version.
- The app searches every conversation a page at a time, merges the pages newest
  first, and "Load more" continues each conversation from its cursor. Opening a
  result jumps to the message.
