// swift-tools-version: 5.9
// Mero Kombat's non-UI layer: the generated contract client, the arena and lobby view models, the
// JS bridge to the game page, the fight pad's input mapping and the presence channel. A plain
// SwiftPM package so `swift build` / `swift test` run it on macOS with no simulator; the app
// (project.yml) links it as a local package.
