// ModelsCore: everything in the iOS app that is not a view. The generated
// contract client, the invitation format, formatting, and the view models.
// It builds and tests on macOS with `swift test`, so none of it needs a
// simulator; project.yml links it into the app.
//
// The swift-sdk pin must match the one in ../project.yml.
