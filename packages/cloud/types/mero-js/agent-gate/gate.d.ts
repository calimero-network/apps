/**
 * A client for mero-agent-gate, the gate in a private agent TD (mero-tee,
 * `mero-agent-gate/`): attest an agent, claim it with your key, give it its
 * secrets sealed to the TD, and release it. It runs where the owner is (a
 * browser, a CLI), so whoever carries the requests, mdma included, sees only
 * quotes and ciphertext.
 *
 * One agent TD hosts several owners' agents, each named by an agent id. For
 * an agent the gate's quote binds, in its report data:
 *
 * `nonce ‖ SHA-256("mero-agent-gate/attest/v3" ‖ provisioning_pub ‖ len(id) ‖ id ‖ signing_pub ‖ owner_pub)`
 *
 * (signing and owner keys 32 zero bytes while unclaimed). {@link attestAgent}
 * checks that and the quote itself before returning anything; every function
 * that sends refuses an agent whose quote names another owner.
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { verify as dcapVerify, getCollateral } from '@phala/dcap-qvl';
 *
 * const policy = await verifySignedAgentPolicy(policyJson, bundleJson, { profile: 'locked-read-only' });
 * const verifier = agentQuoteVerifier(policy, { dcapVerify, fetchCollateral: (q) => getCollateral(PCCS, q) });
 * const owner = await generateOwnerKey(); // keep owner.secret: it is the only key that can change the agent
 * const agent = await attestAgent({ gateUrl, agentId: 'a-1f2e', verifier });
 * await provisionAgent({ gateUrl, agent, ownerSecret: owner.secret, verifier, secrets: { NEAR_AI_API_KEY: key } });
 * ```
